MVC: It stands for Model, View, Controller. It is used to create web applications in Spring boot. It provides tools to automatically configure and wire
     together the model, view and controller.

Model: It handles the data and business logic of the application
View:  It is a user interface and it decides how to represent the data to the user.
Controller: It is used to control the data flow between the Model and View.

JSP: It stands for Java Server Page, and it comes under View layer of MVC. It is like HTML but contains Java code which is executed in the Server to
     generate HTML page which is sent to the user's browser.
     
Dev Tools: Used to auto restart the application whenever the code changes, also used to auto refresh the browser(Live Reload).

Some Dependencies:
    Tomcat-embed-Jasper => To use JSP in our application, we required this dependency
    jstl => Jakarta Standard Library, Used to give additional information to JSP
    spring-boot-devtools => Used to auto restart the application
    
Jsp standard folder structure:
      main -> webapp -> WEB-INF -> jsp
      
Application.yml file is needed to be configured so that prefix and suffix can be added, each time it is not required to explicitly mention the jsp path
in the program


Understanding the Problem statement: We are going to work using MVC
Home -> Registration -> success

Standard good project structure:

Web -> Service -> Domain -> repository

Web: We can say http requests
Service: After the request comes it delegates to the particular service
Domain: Business objects
repository: to store the data (It act as a bridge to the database)
