Bean Scope is the concept which help us to understand the scope of each bean

Two types of scope are there namely, singleton and prototype
Singleton -> Each time if we call it will give the same reference
prototype -> Each time it will give the unique reference

Difference:
Singleton -> Single instance & less memory
Prototype -> Multiple instance & more memory
