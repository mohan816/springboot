Two life cycle methods are there in spring
   1)init() 2) destory()
   
init: This method will be called once the bean is created. Used to initialize the data. This method will be
      called in both singleton and prototype bean scope
destroy: This method will be called before the bean is destroyed. Used to clean up the data. This method will
         be called only in singleton scope.
