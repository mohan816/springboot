Annotation: It's a metadata which means additional information

@Component -> Used to create a bean
@Autowired => Used to inject the dependency to the class, if we use @Autowired to the class then it won't through any error
              if we use the same to the interface and the interface have the multiple implementations then it will through
              no qualifying bean, to handle this we have to use the @Qualifier annotation and mention the name which is
              given in the @Component("")
@Qualifier => Used to specify which bean has to inject to the field.
@Scope -> Is used to specify the scope of the bean
@SpringBootApplication => When comes to web application we have some default configuration we are supposed to do each time
                          to overcome this manual task, spring people comes with this annotation. It execute the application
                          in server. It bundled few annotations namely @Configuration @ComponentScan @EnableAutoConfiguration
                          
yml: Yet another markup language, we are using this file to do the configuration which are required for the application, like port, db connection etc.

Port: It is used to connect to the system. Example: We have some physical ports namely USD,HDMI(Used to connect to the computer) etc. Like this we
      have network port as well.
      
@Service @Controller @Repository -> Based on the requirements developers uses this annotations, and all this annotations represents the bean
