If we have to inject multiple objects using constructor, then it will be cumbersome and the 
readability and maintainability will be less because of it we have setter injection

To use setter injection, we have to declare the setter function in the class where we have to inject the dependency.

In the xml file, instead of constructor-arg we have to use property tag like below
  <property name="tyre" ref="sportsTyre"/>
  
Above name attribute having the value of the variable of the type which we are going to inject
