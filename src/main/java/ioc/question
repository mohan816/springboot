Problem statement
Suppose you are a software developer working at a fintech startup called PayMeNow.



You are assigned to create a console Payment Service application using Spring Boot and the concept of Inversion of Control.



Tasks:-


1. Go to start.spring.io and create a new project.

2. Add the necessary dependencies for the project.

3. Create the PaymentService interface with a processPayment() method and place it in a new package.

4. Create the CreditCardPaymentService, PayPalPaymentService, and BankTransferPaymentService classes, each implementing the PaymentService interface 
and placing them in the same package.

5. Define the bean definitions for each of the PaymentService implementations in the application.xml file.

6. Run and Test the code.
Note:-


1. Don't change the versions of spring-boot (3.0.0) and Java (17). If needed then install the same.

Sample output:-

Enter payment amount
1000
Enter payment method (CreditCard, paypal, or BankTransfer)
CreditCard
Processing credit card payment of $1000.0
